There are several pieces of code that were not written by our team and are not being used like the Histogram class and
the AutoCompletor GUI package and therefore our test cases do not cover them. Otherwise, all other classes have 100% line coverage
and at least 90% branch coverage as confirmed by JaCoCo.
